## The Struggles of Highschool Friendships
### I hope life gets easier

I wish friendships were easier to navigate, instead you ending hating everyone while simultaneously feeling like everyone hates you. 
All I want is to go back to the stability we had last term. We have three more weeks left, surely everything could have waited a little bit longer to eruopt.
Maybe we all just need a break from one another.
