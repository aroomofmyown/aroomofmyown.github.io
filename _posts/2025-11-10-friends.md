## The Struggles of Highschool Friendships
### I hope life gets easier

I wish friendships were easier to navigate, instead you ending hating everyone while simultaneously feeling like everyone hates you. 
All I want is to go back to the stability we had last term. We have three more weeks left, surely everything could have waited a little bit longer to erupt.
Maybe we all just need a break from one another. I've been sick of Billie for a while now, and this whole situation is allowing Buzz to get on my nerves as well. 
At least this is allowing me to get closer to Mars because she hates Billie now.   
  
I had a sleepover with Buzz and she confirmed that Mars had a birthday party in April like I thought, but completely lied about it. She invited Klimt, Billie, Sandy, 
and Poodle, I saw pictures of them all hanging out around her birthday on Klimt's instagram. Then later she told me she didn't have a birthday party, bringing it up herself, I didn't even say anything, just had suspicions. It's as if Mars thinks I'm stupid, I'm not and it hurts, and she tried to do it about Villette's party too, saying it was just me and her who went to the city, when we all posted about it on Instagram.
