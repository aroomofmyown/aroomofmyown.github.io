## Sunday 9/11 - Saturday 15/11  
### A debrief of my week  

Yesterday I had basketball, I scored 18 points and Klimt got 22, it was her first game since she had surgery, and Bunga got 6, we were the only scorers. 
I want to work on my shooting, most of my shots went in so it was kind of luck, but the past few weeks I have been top scorer and now Klimt is back I need to keep 
practicing to become the top scorer again, because I really want MVP. Klimt is one of my best friends, and I love her, but friendly competition isn't hurting anyone.
