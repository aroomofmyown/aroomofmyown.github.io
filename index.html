	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p> Recently I've been feeling a longing for a private space that is truly private. 
		I keep a diary, however that is still in my room where others could find and read it (it's not really hidden anyway).
		I was attracted to the idea of a website due to its non-physical nature, it can't be 'found' if I don't want it to be.
		Hopefully I use this, I plan for it to be a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and music. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/wiki">📚 Personal Wiki</a> for my notes and most of this site's content.</li>
		<li><a href="/wiki/navigation-guide">🧭 Index</a> to see a table of contents.</li>
		<li><a href="/blog">🛖 Blog</a> Still a Work in Progress.</li>
		<li><a href="/about">🏝️ Music Gallery</a> Where I store any audio files.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> I'd like to stay anonymous, if I even publish this, so the only way to contact me will be through my email, linked below. Or if you are very
	desperate you could reach out on github, you know my username already. </p> </div>
