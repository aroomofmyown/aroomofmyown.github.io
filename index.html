	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p> Recently I've been feeling a longing for a private space that is truly private. 
		I keep a diary, however that is still in my room where others could find and read it (it's not really hidden anyway).
		I was attracted to the idea of a website due to its non-physical nature, it can't be 'found' if I don't want it to be.
		I will use this to say what's on my mind, good or bad, without fear of anyone I know ever reading it. I will still use codes and won't
		write my name in any form, but I have complete trust that this will be undiscovered. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/wiki">📚 Personal Wiki</a> for my notes and most of this site's content.</li>
		<li><a href="/wiki/navigation-guide">🧭 Index</a> to see a table of contents.</li>
		<li><a href="/blog">🛖 Blog</a> Not sure how much I'll use this.</li>
		<li><a href="/about">🏝️ Music Gallery</a> Still working on this.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> I'd like to stay anonymous, if I even publish this, so the only way to contact me will be through my email, linked below. Or if you are very
	desperate you could reach out on github, you know my username already. </p> </div>
