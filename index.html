	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p> Recently I've been feeling a longing for a private space that is truly private. 
		I keep a diary, however that is still in my room where others could find and read it (it's not really hidden anyway).
		I was attracted to the idea of a website due to its non-physical nature, it can't be 'found' if I don't want it to be.
		Hopefully I use this, I plan for it to be a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and music. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/wiki">📚 Personal Wiki</a> for my notes and most of this site's content.</li>
		<li><a href="/wiki/navigation-guide">🧭 Index</a> to see a table of contents.</li>
		<li><a href="/blog">🛖 Blog</a> Still a Work in Progress.</li>
		<li><a href="/about">🏝️ About</a> To learn more about me.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> Or you could just chill here and contact me through any of these channels. </p> </div>
